    "The system must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a deck or more deck of cards \n",
    "- Shuffle the decks \n",
    "- Distribute the cards to a set amout od players \n",
    "- Distributes the cards to the dealer\n",
    "- Checks what poker combinations are on the table\n",
    "- Calcualtes the probability of each combiantion\n",
    "- Vizualize this probability\n",

    " ## Poker Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to create a Python simulation of the game of poker to investigate if, over a large number of games, the actual probabilities of getting different poker hand combinations are reflected by the frequency of those combinations occurring in the simulation results. This is a common approach in statistics and probability to empirically verify theoretical probabilities through simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the general steps you can follow to implement this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Poker Game Rules:**\n",
    "   - Define the rules of the poker game you want to simulate. This includes details like the deck of cards, the number of players, and the hand ranking (e.g., royal flush, full house, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulate Poker Games:**\n",
    "   - Write Python code to simulate a large number of poker games. In each game, shuffle the deck, deal cards to players, and evaluate the poker hands for each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keep Track of Hand Combinations:**\n",
    "   - Maintain counters or data structures to keep track of the number of times each poker hand combination occurs (e.g., how many times a player gets a royal flush, full house, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run a Large Number of Simulations:**\n",
    "   - Run the simulations for a significant number of games (e.g., tens of thousands or more) to get statistically meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze and Compare:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the simulation results to see if the observed frequencies of each poker hand combination match the theoretical probabilities. You can calculate the empirical probabilities based on your simulation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualize the Results:**\n",
    "   - Create charts or visualizations to present your findings. This can help illustrate any discrepancies between theoretical and empirical probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Refine and Experiment:**\n",
    "   - You can refine your simulation and experiment with different parameters (e.g., number of players, deck variations) to see how they affect the results.\n",
